# Chest-X-Ray-Pneumonia-Detection-CNN
Detection of Pneumonia Infected Disease cells using cell images, deployed using Flask.




Dataset taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). Since the dataset was really imbalanced, I tried creating models using data augmentation, as well as manually balancing the datasets. 


The folder 'Models' contain the .h5 model file created using the CNN model.  
The model was deployed using Flask. 



### Run the app.py file to initiate the model deployment in the web browser.
